Project management
===================

Responsibilities and tips for running your project.


Roles of student and supervisor
--------------------------------

**Student**


Unlike previous courses, in thesis projects, you are the project
manager. This means you are responsible for:

* Making and adhering to milesones (deadlines)  
* Deciding weekly tasks  
* Inviting to, planning and running supervision meetings  
* Communicating to me WELL in advance if you want a review on anything (|gt|\ 1 week)  
* Realizing you are stuck and need support to get out, then asking for it

**Supervisor**

To provide technical expertise, guidance on project management
and practice in fielding questions and defending your research.


Weekly meetings
-----------------

* Student shall send recurring invitation to weekly meetings.  
* You should prepare for each meeting by making slides (see next
  next bullet) and having a clear goal for the meeting.  

   * If you don't have topics to discuss with supervision team,
     **CANCEL** the meeting!

* Please make weekly powerpoints that are placed in your project Team.  

   * I would like that you use 
     :download:`this powerpoint template <_static/YYYY.MM.DD_NAME_weekly.pptx>`. 
     I believe it's effective for student projects, and it makes it
     easier for me to switch from project to project.     



Example milestones
-------------------

Here are example of key milestones that you should track for your project.
I recommend adding intermediate milestones to help you stay on target.
(E.g., "documentation of preliminary analysis of database added to thesis draft".)

 * DD.MM: First draft of project timeline and dates for key milestones (suggested: Week 2)  
 * DD.MM: Project plan submitted submitted to CampusNet (suggested: Week 4)  
 * DD.MM: Polished draft of thesis submitted to supervision team for review (suggested: 2 weeks before hand-in)  
 * DD.MM: Final draft thesis submitted to CampusNet  

How to book meetings
----------------------

If it is not in my calendar, I will forget it.

To check when my calendar is free:

* Log onto outlook.office.com using your DTU credentials.
* On the left tab, click the Calendar button.
* Click “Add calendar” - “Add from directory”.
* Choose your student account, then enter my email address.
* You should be able to add and then view my free/busy/etc. times.
