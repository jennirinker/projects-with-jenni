Presentation
-------------

A defence presentation is typically 30 minutes long.
The structure should be similar to your report: what is the problem you are trying to solve, how did you try to solve it, and how well did your method work.

Here is an excellent example of how one can structure a defence presentation that clearly defines and highlights the “story” behind the work (requires DTU login): `example MSc defence <https://panopto.dtu.dk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=45320e4b-d3dd-4d07-ac51-b29800e3ac4f>`_.
