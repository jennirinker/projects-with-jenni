Literature survey
===================

A literature survey, or literature review, is where you investigate whether other
people have tried to solve the same problem as you and, if so, how they did it.
The outcome of the literature survey is not only a synthesis of different
solution methods in the literature but also identification of gaps in the state
of the art. Your research should fall within said gaps.

The information here is terse. I highly recommend you google to find more guides.
Also, go talk to the librarians! It's literally their job to do this.


Overview of steps
-------------------

`This article <https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/c.php?g=1060589&p=7710319>`_ has a nice summary of the process.
Some extra tips from me are below.

Identifying papers to read
-----------------------------

* Different papers may be relevant for different researh questions. 
* Use Google Scholar to find options, then DTU FindIt to get the paper PDF.  


Keeping track of papers
-----------------------------

* `Zotero <https://www.zotero.org/>`_ seems to be the best current solution for tracking papers as you read them. It also integrates nicely with Overleaf.  
* You can use tags/collections in Zotero to indicate if you've read the paper yet, which research question it's relevant for, etc.  
* I like making a table with all the papers I read. Each row is a new paper. The columns are: BibTeX ID, title, 1-sentence summary, categories (e.g., which research questions it's relevant for, what topic does it fall under, etc.), key conclusions from their results (bullet list) pros (bullet list), cons (bullet list) and notes (bullet list).  


Synthesizing the results
-------------------------

* I recommend using a synthesis matrix to synthesize the information across different papers by topic. Here are some examples:  

    * https://guides.library.jhu.edu/ld.php?content_id=16149009 (my preference)  
    * https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/library/docs/research-guides/gradproskills/Lit-review-synthesis-matrix-Word.docx

I recommend the first example because each row corresponds to a topic, which should naturally become a paragraph (or more) when you write the actual literature survey.

Writing the literature survey
------------------------------

Documentation of the literature survey becomes a "State of the art" section in your thesis.
This section should answer two questions:  

1. How have other researchers tried to solve your problem?  
2. Where are the gaps in the state of the art?  

In engineering, literature surveys are organized by topic/methodology. It is common to subdivide state-of-the-art sections into subsections by topic for easier reading. Papers may be cited in multiple sections if they span topics.
