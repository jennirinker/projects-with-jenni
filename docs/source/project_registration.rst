Project definition and registration
====================================

You should start defining your project at least a month before your desired start date.
The earlier the better.

Defining your project
----------------------

If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with:  

* A few sentences saying which project you're interested in and why.  

    * If you aren't contacting me regarding a specific project, please list your areas of interest/expertise.

* What skills you have/courses you have taken that are relevant for working with me. Include both engineering and programming skills/courses.  
* Your transcript from DTU.  

I will respond, likely asking you to book me for a half-hour discussion to loosely define your project.
(See how to book me in :ref:`project_management`).
If I take too long too respond, feel free to send another email or just invite me to a half-hour meeting when my calendar is free.


Registration in the system
----------------------------

Once we have loosely defined your project, you should fill out
:download:`this template for project registration <_static/project_indberetning_template.docx>`
and send it to the supervision team for review. This should be done at least
2 weeks before your desired start date. Examples of project descriptions are below.

Once the feedback from the supervision team is integrated into the project-registration
form, I will register the project in the system. We are then ready for the
:ref:`onboarding`.


**Example project descriptions**

#. MSc. "This master project analyses the dynamics of a wind turbine with multiple rotors that are operating at different rotor speeds. As a baseline for the project, modal analysis is performed on a simplified two-rotor system, and the mode shapes are examined for synchronous and asynchronous rotors. A HAWC2 model of the two-rotor system is constructed and the response is analysed and compared to the linear model. Potential project expansions include (1) an analysis of the system when a cable connects the two rotors and (2) the inclusion of aerodynamic forces in the system."  
#. MSc. "The IEA 15 MW is a reference wind turbine model that was created to develop and test the next generation of technologies for wind turbines of the future. This master’s project, which is a collaboration between DTU and NREL, evaluates the stability of the IEA 15 MW when mounted on the UMaine semisubmersible platform. The platform model is implemented in HAWC2, and the turbine is controlled using both NREL’s ROSCO controller and the DTU WEC controller. The performance of the closed-loop system is evaluated in terms of stability and loads. Depending on the results of the analysis, the controller(s) will be updated to improve the performance of the turbine."  
#. BSc. "This project develops a dynamic model for determining mean-wind-speed profiles based on LiDAR data. Various LiDAR technologies are reviewed, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses. Parametric models for shear profiles in atmospheric flow are described, with the aim of selecting a suitable model. The project uses simulations and/or existing data as the basis for developing the model. First, a method is developed to estimate model parameters from the collected data, and this estimation method is then extended to handle dynamic and continuous data. The validity of the developed model is assessed by testing it on new test cases, which include different shear profiles as well as time-varying profiles. Finally, the algorithm’s applicability in real-world applications is evaluated."
