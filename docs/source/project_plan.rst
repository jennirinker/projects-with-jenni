Project plan
===============

Here you define the problem your research is trying to solve, how other
researchers have tried to solve it, your research questions and your
learning objectives. Deadline and hand-in is on CampusNet project,
under Assignments.


Contents of the project plan
-----------------------------

I suggest the following structure: 

* **Background/Motivation**. What is the problem you are trying to solve?  

    * You should always have a short, clear and accurate answer to this question. Very likely from a censor...

* **Preliminary literature survey**. How have other people tried to solve the problem (or related problems)?  

    * More info: :ref:`literature_survey`.  

* **Research questions**. What research questions will you answer as you try to solve the problem?

    * Ideally, your thesis will start with your research questions and, in the conclusion, explain the answer to each based on your results.

* **Learning objectives**. What skills will you acquire in this project?  

    * Example: "During this project, I will learn how to: (a) calculate and analyse two-point statistics or turbulence, (b) tune model parameters to data, ...".  
    * Per DTU rules, they should take into account DTU's overall learning objectives. See rules at bottom.
